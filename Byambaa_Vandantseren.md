Hi everyone! I’m Byambaa. 
I grew up in the Siberian taiga, surrounded by a nomadic lifestyle. 
It might seem like a world away from coding.
But, the problem-solving skills and adaptability I learned in that environment have really fueled my interest in technology. 
I’m excited to dive into this coding program and learn with all of you!.
